# 🦆 Everybody Codes 2024 🦆

Solutions for the [Everybody Codes 2024](https://everybody.codes/event/2024/quests) puzzles, written in Javascript.

This challenge consists on solving 20 Quests. As described by them:

> Every Quest starts with Part I, which is designed for everyone to solve within a reasonable amount of time, even if you don't have any coding skills, so everyone can join in!
>
> Once you provide the correct answer, Part II will open. It's a continuation of Part I, but a little more complicated. It usually needs some coding skills, or at least some knowledge of Excel.
>
> Solving Part II takes you to Part III. This part aims to challenge you as much as possible!
>
> Remember, you're solving puzzles, not finding general solutions, so checking your input notes could be important! Each part has different input notes, so make sure that you copy the proper one.

My aim is to code efficient solutions and provide an explanation for each of them.

Thanks [Emil Kaczyński](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-kaczy%C5%84ski-a5a05872/) and team for organising this event!

## Project structure

Every Quest has its own folder:

-   `part_1_input.txt`: input for Part I
-   `part_1_solution.js`: solution for Part I
-   `part_2_input.txt`: input for Part II
-   `part_2_solution.js`: solution for Part II
-   `part_3_input.txt`: input for Part III
-   `part_3_solution.js`: solution for Part III
-   `README.md`: explanation for Part I, II and III solutions

## How to run

You just need Node >=20.5.1 to run the solutions.

For example, if you want to run the solution of Quest 1 / Part I:

```bash
node quest_01/part_1_solution
```
